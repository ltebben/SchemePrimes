# SchemePrimes
Primes is a simple program to output the first n prime numbers. Must have a rough estimate of how many integers the first n numbers will be contained in, which is estimated as n*20

Primes2 does basically the same thing, but uses force-and-delay of lambda to create streams so there is no need to estimate... the integers can go on forever.
